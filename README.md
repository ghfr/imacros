# Macros with iMacros

## Getting started 
* Download iMacros for Firefox. You can't run JavaScript Macros with the Chrome extension.
* In the Record section click on 'Record' to create your first file
* Using right click on the file rename it to 'name.js'
* Then edit your macro and replace the code by one of the examples above
* In the Play section run the macro

Your csv files are saved in the Downloads folder of your iMacros folder
