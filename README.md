# Macros with iMacro

## Getting started 
* Download iMacros for Firefox. You can't run JavaScript Macros with the Chrome extension.
* In the Record section click on 'Record' to create your first file
* Using right click on the file rename it to 'name.js'
* Then edit your macro and replace the code by one of my examples
* In the Play section run the macro


To create your own macros you can use [LeCoupa's CheatSheet](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/4d87296efe4266505acb)
