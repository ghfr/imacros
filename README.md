# Macros with iMacros

## Getting started 
* Download iMacros for Firefox. You can't run JavaScript Macros with the Chrome extension.
* In the Record section click on 'Record' to create your first file
* Using right click on the file rename it to 'name.js'
* In the Manage Section click on 'Edit Macro' to edit your macro. Replace the code by one of the examples above
* In the Play section run the macro by clicking the 'Play' button

Your csv files are saved in the Downloads folder of your iMacros folder
